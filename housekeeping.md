# Housekeeping

This grand outline for Sahoki can be changes via regular processes, but to actually submit changes to it, they must be submitted as a pull request for review on this wiki's GitHub found here. With proper evidence of the changes passing, the MDIT will approve and merge it (append to the Grand Outline). It is also recommended that a pull request be submitted to review for changes that have \*not\* passed, so that they can be reviewed in order to pass. However, this should be done with explicit notation that it has not passed.

Negligence to follow proper protocol and ettiquete will not be tolerated.
