# Court of Balance

The Court of Balance is a completely independent court that polices certain decisions in contexts where balance is needed. The situations where the Court of Balance has authority are mentioned elsewhere, in their respective documents, but includes Parliament's changes to [department-overseen](../lawbook/lawbook-guide.md) laws.
