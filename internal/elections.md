# Elections

Election terms are about six months, elections being held on the third Saturday of August and February yearly. Elections should be announced and parties allowed to register and start campaigning 1 week prior. There should be allowed one day after the election date to count the votes and declare the winner, and a second day after that to form the parliament.

There are 2 separate elections at each election time: **Election for Parliament** and **Election for Prime Minister**.

### Election for Parliament

This vote is a standard vote, where voters pick one option. The percentage of the vote is applied as close as possible to the seats. So, if one party got 50% of the vote, they would get 50% of the seats, as accurately as possible. Only parties are allowed to run in the election for parliament. The seats won by a party are to be occupied by someone from the party, that the party appoints, who lasts the entire term in that seat until a new parliament is formed (unless they quit, which means the seat remains vacant and votes don't consider that seat).

Each election for Parliament, the number of seats should be recalculated by the monarch. There can be no less than 2, and should reflect the amount of representatives available to hold the seats and the percentages of the vote, to ensure that the seats match best the percentages. The result of the calculation can be same as the last, as long as it works properly to the results of the election as if it were recalculated.

### Election for Prime Minister

This vote is a ranked choice vote. After calculations of the vote, the winner is declared the PM. Only individuals are allowed to run for Prime Minister, but, in addition to running for or holding the role of PM, they can be:

* aligned with a party (good practice)
* part of a party
* part of a party and holding a seat in parliament
* part of a party and in line to hold a seat in parliament if the right conditions are met

***

The Prime Minister can call an election at any time (without vote), but it does not change or cancel the default election dates. This means an election can be called by the PM in July, but there would still be an election in August. There is no way to override this.

If the Prime Minister dies with proof while in office, an election is called for both Prime Minister and the Parliament.

Anyone participating in any election or Parliament needs to have Saheok citizenship.
