# Elections

Election terms are about six months, elections being held on the third Saturday of August and February yearly. Elections should be announced and parties allowed to register and start campaigning 1 week prior. There should be allowed one day after the election date to count the votes and declare the winner, and a day after that to form the parliament. Elections requirements are paused in a state of martial law (See [military & defence](military-and-defence.md)).

There are 2 separate elections at each election time: **Election for Parliament** and **Election for Prime Minister**.

### Election for Parliament

Parliament is comprised of seats explained in [parliament & PM](parliament-and-pm.md). The citizens of the riding a seat represents elects a candidate for their seat in a ranked choice poll. If there is no voting population in a specific riding, that seat is declared vacant and it will vote “vacant” in all parliamentary votes, to be treated as an abstention.

One person can run for no more than 2 seats. They do not have to be a citizen within that riding. Any candidate can be representing a registered political party. A political party cannot have more than 1 of its candidates running in a riding at a time. A candidate does not have to represent a political party (they can run as an independent).

Elected Members of Parliament last the entire term until a new election is called. If an MP resigns during the term, their seat is then considered vacant as per [parliament & PM](parliament-and-pm.md).

**Political Parties**
Political parties, which can run its candidates in multiple ridings, can be registered with the [ID of Elections](departments/id-of-elections.md) (as do all candidates). There will usually be an option to do so when elections become closer in time.

### Election for Prime Minister

This vote is a ranked choice vote. After calculations of the vote, the winner is declared the PM. Only individuals are allowed to run for Prime Minister, but, in addition to running for or holding the role of PM, they can be:

- aligned with a party
- otherwise part of a party
- holding or running to hold a seat in parliament simultaneously

The Prime Minister can call an election at any time (without vote), but it does not change or cancel the default election dates. This means an election can be called by the PM in July, but there would still be an election in August. Elections requirements are paused in a state of martial law (See [military & defence](military-and-defence.md)).

If the Prime Minister dies with proof while in office, an election is called for both Prime Minister and the Parliament.

Anyone participating in any election (whether running or voting) needs to have Saheok citizenship.
