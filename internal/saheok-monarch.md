# Saheok Monarch

Sahoki also has a monarch, a position currently held by Hugh. The monarch can appoint a successor if they choose. The monarch is responsible for implementing the internal structure and laws of the government, managing the Monarchial Department of IT (MDIT), and can veto changes to constitutional laws in the handbook, though they cannot propose changes themselves.

The monarch is mostly a ceremonial position, and Hugh has it because they founded the nation.
