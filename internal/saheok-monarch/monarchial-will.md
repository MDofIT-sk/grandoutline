# Monarchial Will

This is the will of Hue regarding their reign as monarch.

***

> Crown TimothÃ©e Chalamet if I die or abdicate on Saheok, Canadian, or other British Commonwealth territory. If I die/abdicate in a country not mentioned without signs of being forced to, dissolve the government in its entirety without question. The rest of the monarchial will is available privately to the Office of the Prime Minister.
