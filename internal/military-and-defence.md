# Military & Defence

This regards the military and defence of Sahoki.

**Military Formation** 

The military is divided into groups, there being 2 types of groups:
- Unit / Regular unit of forces
- Militia / A unit of forces that is partly autonomous and has its own imagery/symbolism

Different units/militias are responsible for certain areas of warfare. Sahoki is involved in several types of warfare:
- Cyberwarfare
- Economic warfare
- Social warfare
- (Minor) Ground warfare

Recruits for the military should be recruited on a voluntary basis.

**Martial Law**

The PM can activate martial law at any time, but it can be reversed by the CB (Court of Balance). Martial law means:
- All departments must take and implement orders from the SDF (Saheok Defence Forces)
- Elections are paused for the duration of the martial law, but must be held immediately after the martial law goes out of effect, regardless of why
