# Elections

Election terms are about six months, elections being held on the third Saturday of August and February yearly. Elections should be announced and parties allowed to register and start campaigning 1 week prior. There should be allowed one day after the election date to count the votes and declare the winner, and a second day after that to form the parliament.

There are 2 separate elections at each election time: **Election for Parliament** and **Election for Prime Minister**.

### Election for Parliament

This vote is a standard vote, where voters pick one option. The percentage of the vote is applied as close as possible to the seats. So, if one party got 50% of the vote, they would get 50% of the seats, as accurately as possible. Only parties are allowed to run in the election for parliament. The seats won by a party are to be occupied by someone from the party, that the party appoints, who lasts the entire term in that seat until a new parliament is formed (unless they quit, which means the seat remains vacant and votes don't consider that seat).
