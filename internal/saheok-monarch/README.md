# Saheok Monarch

Sahoki also has a monarch, a position currently held by Hue. The monarch can appoint a successor if they choose. The monarch is responsible for implementing the internal structure and laws of the government, managing the Monarchial Department of IT (MDIT), and can [veto changes to constitutional laws](../../lawbook/lawbook-guide.md) in the handbook, though they cannot propose changes themselves.

The monarch is mostly a ceremonial position, and Hue has it because they founded the nation.

If a monarch abdicates or dies during their reign, the role is handed over to their appointed successor (available in the monarch's [monarchial will](monarchial-will.md)).
