# Parliament and PM

The Saheok parliament consists of 7 seats that represent different groups of people (ridings). Each seat should be occupied by a member of parliament elected by that riding. If a seat is vacant as a result of zero voting population, it votes “vacant” in all parliamentary votes, which is treated as an abstention.

The seats are as follows: († Department-locked, [ID of Elections](departments/id-of-elections.md))
1. Lisgar 29 - *Represents citizens from Lisgar graduating in 2029*
2. Lisgar 28 - *Represents citizens from Lisgar graduating in 2028*
3. Lisgar 27 - *Represents citizens from Lisgar graduating in 2027*
4. Lisgar 26 - *Represents citizens from Lisgar graduating in 2026*
5. Colonel By - *Represents all citizens at Colonel By*
6. Europa - *Represents all citizens in Europe*
7. Other - *Represents other citizens that aren’t accounted for in any other group*
