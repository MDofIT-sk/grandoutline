# Lawbook Guide

The lawbook is the laws of Sahoki, organized in different categories. Different categories (and sometimes, but rarely, specific laws) are governed differently, and the key below defines certain symbols with their meaning.



| Symbol    | Name                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No symbol | Regular             | Voted on in a first-past-the-post vote by the Parliament, like regular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| \*        | Constitutional      | Can be changed after a successful vote of a victory of at least two thirds, and also approved by the monarch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| \*\*      | Monarch-locked      | Only editable by the monarch with no other clauses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| †         | Department-locked   | Cannot be edited via a parliamentary vote. All changes of said laws must be made by the mentioned department who manages them.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ‡         | Department-overseen | Can be edited by parliament by a vote of a victory of at least half (regular vote). However, it is still administered by a department. The department can later reverse the change. There should be no overstepping of power, and so the Supreme Court can veto any of the Parliament's motions to change a law that is department-overseen. |
