# Parliament and PM

The Saheok parliament consists of seats filled based on proportional representation from party votes (number of seats recalculated each [election](elections.md)). Each party sends delegates to occupy the seats they win according to the percentage of the vote received. The prime minister is elected through an instant runoff vote, where any candidate can run by stating their values. Often, candidates are members or leaders of existing parties. The prime minister can also occupy a parliamentary seat if they are part of a party and are selected as a delegate. Parliament votes on bills using a first-past-the-post system, unless the law in question, specified in the lawbook, details another method to change it.

**Powers and Responsibilities of the Prime Minister:**

1. **Head of State:**
   * Serve as the primary representative of Saheok both domestically and internationally.
2. **Diplomatic Actions:**
   * Establish and maintain diplomatic relations with other countries.
   * Represent Saheok in international organizations and negotiations.
3. **Foreign Policy:**
   * Formulate and oversee the implementation of Saheok's foreign policy.
4. **Appointing Leaders:**
   * Appoint leaders of directorial departments to manage various sectors such as finance, defense, education, and health.
5. **Parliamentary Functions:**
   * Break tie votes in parliament to ensure decisions can be made.
6. **Public Communication:**
   * Address the nation on key issues and government policies.

### Sessions of Parliament

The Parliament will have sessions (meetings) in which all members of Parliament (MPs, those holding seats) and the Prime Minister (PM) discuss. These don't regularly, happen, as the process for making decisions usually happens as an online discussion with an eventual vote, only happening when provoked.
