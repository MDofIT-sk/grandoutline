# Monarchial Will

This is the will of Hue regarding their reign as monarch.

***

> I kind of wrote the law to give myself a will but I don't know what to put here at the moment. Just crown TimothÃ©e Chalamet if I die or abdicate. However, if I die/abdicate in/from a foreign country other than the those in the British Commonwealth, dissolve the government in its entirety without question.
