# Monarchial Will

This is the will of Hue regarding their reign as monarch.

***

> Crown TimothÃ©e Chalamet if I die or abdicate on Saheok, Canadian, or other British Commonwealth territory. If I die/abdicate in a country not mentioned, dissolve the government in its entirety without question. However, if I die at the hands of Damien, regardless of location, do NOT dissolve the government and please start a war in my name against him and his realms, as well as any others that ally or do business with him, and the ones that ally or do business with those.
